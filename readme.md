# FluxBB 1.5 Readme

## About

FluxBB is an open source forum application released under the GNU General Public
Licence. It is free to download and use and will remain so. FluxBB was conceived and
designed to be fast and light with less of the "not so essential" features that some
of the other forums have whilst not sacrificing essential functionality or usability.

## Requirements

* A webserver
* PHP 5.6.4 or later
* A database such as MySQL 5.0.6 or later, PostgreSQL 7.0 or later, or SQLite 2

## Recommendations

* Make use of a PHP accelerator such as APC or XCache
* Make sure PHP has the zlib module installed to allow FluxBB to gzip output
